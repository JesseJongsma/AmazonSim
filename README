We have created an Amazon simulator. You can purchase products by typing {your product} (in the console), one product equals 10 articles. 
This product comes in a Rack. The Rack is brought by a spaceship to the storage and the robots put the rack in a free space.

If you would like to order products as user you can do so by typing {your product, ammount per piece}. This is only possible when you
have enough stock available. For example, if you order 3 apples then there will still be 7 apples in the rack. The 3 apples are
removed from the rack and are brought to your home by the spaceship. The other 7 apples in the Rack are brought back in to the storage. 

Commands: 
 - Deliver to the storage:
   Type: {Your product}
   
 - Order a product:
   Type: {Your Product, ammount per piece}
